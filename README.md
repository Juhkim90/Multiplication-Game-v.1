## Fast Math

For this test you will use everything we've been learning to create a multiplication game. 

How the game works: 
1. The computer will first introduce the game and its rules 
2. The computer will ask if the user is ready to start 
3. The computer will choose 2 random numbers between 0-12
4. The computer will ask the user the multiplication question. 
5. The user has 3 seconds to answer
6. Once the 3 seconds are up, the computer will end the game
7. If the user answers correctly, the computer will ask another multiplication question and restart the timer
8. The computer will keep track of the total score
